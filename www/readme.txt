Radio Systems Corporation (RSC)/PetSafe

Project: Retext

Scenario:  

RSC runs an ad (TV, radio, YouTube, etc.) that promotes a particular product or special 

offer.  The ad’s call-to-action prompts the user to send a text message to a specified phone 

number and in return they get a link to the special offer.  For example:  Text “Dog Bone” to 

865-444-2222 and get a response: http://store.petsafe.net/new_super_dog_bone_offer

response message.
